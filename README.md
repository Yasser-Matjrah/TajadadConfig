    ```json
    {
    	"sort": "quantity",
    	"order": "asc",
    	"filters": [
    		{
    			"field": "price",
    			"operand": ">=",

    	]
    }
    ```

2. Filter products where the name contains "apple":

```json
{
	"sort": "name",
	"order": "ASC",
	"filters": [
		{
			"field": "name",
			"operand": "LIKE",
			"value": "apple"
		}
	]
}
